**Solution:** Split into two entries
```
Entry 1:
- Amount: ₱3,000
- Category: Community Living → Food & Household
- Note: "Groceries from total receipt"

Entry 2:
- Amount: ₱2,000
- Category: Ministry → Parish Operations
- Note: "Parish supplies from total receipt"
```

### **Scenario B: Unclear Category**

**Problem:** Bought books - are they for personal study or ministry?

**Decision Guide:**
```
Personal spiritual reading → Formation → Books & Resources
Teaching materials for parish → Ministry → Parish Operations
Seminary textbooks → Formation → Seminary Expenses
```

### **Scenario C: One-time vs Recurring**

**Problem:** Monthly electric bill vs one-time repair

**Both use same category!**
```
Monthly electric: Community Living → Utilities
One-time repair: Community Living → Maintenance

The category shows WHAT it is, not HOW OFTEN
